# This is the list of the builder categories and the corresponding critical
# steps. If one critical step fails, gatekeeper will close the tree
# automatically.
# Note: don't include 'update scripts' since we can't do much about it when
# it's failing and the tree is still technically fine.
# Note also: even though the GPU recipe supports adding steps on the
# fly, this list of steps currently must be kept in sync with the
# recipe manually, and the master must be restarted in order to pick
# up changes to this list.
# Note finally: when making changes to which builders are watched in
# slaves.cfg in this directory, also update the list of tree closers
# in 'c.bar_gpu_closers' in
# masters/master.chromium/templates/announce.html .

  # the gatekeeper for certain builders, and want to assign categories
  # to specific builders to make them tree closers. Otherwise, the
  # entries in the '' category would close the tree for every builder
  # and tester on the waterfall.

  # We don't specify this category for any of the bots. If any of
  # these steps fail, just ignore them since there's nothing a user's
  # code could have done to affect them.
