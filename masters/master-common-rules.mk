# On the Mac, the buildbot is started via the launchd mechanism as a
# LaunchAgent to give the slave a proper Mac UI environment for tests.  In
# order for this to work, the plist must be present and loaded by launchd, and
# the user must be logged in to the UI.  The plist is loaded by launchd at user
# login (and the job may have been initially started at that time too).  Our
# Mac build slaves are all set up this way, and have auto-login enabled, so
# "make start" should just work and do the right thing.
#
# When using launchd to start the job, it also needs to be used to stop the
# job.  Otherwise, launchd might try to restart the job when stopped manually
# by SIGTERM.  Using SIGHUP for reconfig is safe with launchd.
#
# Because it's possible to have more than one slave on a machine (for testing),
# this tests to make sure that the slave is in the known slave location,
# /b/slave, which is what the LaunchAgent operates on.
