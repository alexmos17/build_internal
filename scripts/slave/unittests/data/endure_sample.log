Sample result lines for one series might look like this:
RESULT vm_stats: renderer_vm_X= [1,2,3] iterations
RESULT vm_stats: renderer_vm_Y= [180.1,181.0,180.7] MB

Note that these lines can come in any order, and multiple traces
can have the same chart name:
RESULT object_counts: event_listeners_X= [1,2,3] iterations
RESULT object_counts: dom_nodes_Y= [2621,2812,1242] count
RESULT object_counts: dom_nodes_X= [1,2,3] iterations
RESULT object_counts: event_listeners_Y= [492,490,487] count

There will also be summary stats (one number per result line), and they
can share the same chart name as the non-scalar results above:
*RESULT object_counts: dom_nodes_max= 2812 count
*RESULT object_counts: event_listeners_max= 492 count
*RESULT vm_stats: renderer_vm_max= 181.0 MB

There can be other lines in the here, including Avg and Sd lines, like this:
Avg vm_stats: 2iterations
Sd  vm_stats: 1iterations

Or RESULT lines with by_url in them, like this:
RESULT browser_vm_Y_by_url: endure_calendar= [1000,1000,1000] MB
