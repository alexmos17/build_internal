    1. Tweak default task parameters applied to all swarming tasks (such as
       task_os_dimension and task_priority). This step is optional.
    2. Isolate some test using 'isolate' recipe module. Get isolated hash as
       a result of that process.
    3. Create a task configuration using 'task(...)' method, providing
       isolated hash obtained previously.
    4. Tweak the task parameters. This step is optional.
    5. Launch the task on swarming by calling 'trigger(...)'.
    6. Continue doing useful work locally while the task is running concurrently
       on swarming.
    7. Wait for task to finish and collect its result (exit code, logs)
       by calling 'collect(...)'.

  See also example.py for concrete code.
