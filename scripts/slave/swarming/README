Scripts in this directory acts as the liason (a buffer) between the master and
the swarming_client code.

This helps with master restarts and when swarming_client is updated. It helps
support older versions of the client code, without having to complexify the
master code.

So scripts in this directory should be called from the master, which then can
defer to the relevant script.
