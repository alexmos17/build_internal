"""Utility class to build the Swarm master BuildFactory's.

Based on chromium_factory.py and adds chromium-on-swarm-specific steps.

Common usage:
- For a split builder&tester configuration, use:
  - One ChromiumFactory() builder with 'run_default_swarm_tests' set to True.
  - One SwarmTestBuilder() builder named 'swarm_triggered', the builder name
    is currently hardcoded.

- For a single buildertester configuration, use:
  - SwarmFactory()
