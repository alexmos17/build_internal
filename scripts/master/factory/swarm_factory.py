"""Utility class to build the Swarm main BuildFactory's.

Based on chromium_factory.py and adds chromium-on-swarm-specific steps.

Common usage:
- For a split builder&tester configuration, use:
  - One ChromiumFactory() builder with 'run_default_swarm_tests' set to the list
    of tests to run on Swarm on the 'tester'.
  - One SwarmTestBuilder() builder named something like 'linux_swarm_triggered'.
    It is defined as fp['swarming_triggered_builder']

- For a single buildertester configuration, use:
  - SwarmFactory()
