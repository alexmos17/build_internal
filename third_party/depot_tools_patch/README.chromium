Description:
Used by patch_path_filter.py and its unit test. A specific version is needed to
ensure not breaking patching due to changes in the auto-updated depot_tools.

NOTICE: Initially the directory containing this was named depot_tools, but it
turns out that interferes with other scripts looking for the real depot_tools,
so please don't rename it to depot_tools.

Local Modifications:
None.
